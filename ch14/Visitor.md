- **Visitor Pattern**
  - Use the Visitor Pattern when you want to add capabilities to a composite of objects and encapsulation is not important
- **Benefits**
  - Allows you to add operations to a Composite structure without changing the structure itself
  - Adding new operations is relatively easy
  - The code for operations performed by the Vistor is centralized
- **Drawbacks**
  - The Composite classes' encapsulation broken when the Visitor is used
  - Because the traversal function is involved, changes to the Composite structure are more difficult
