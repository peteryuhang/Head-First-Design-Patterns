- **The Memento Pattern**
  - Use this pattern when you need to be able to return an object to one of its previous state; for instance, if your user requests an "undo"
- **Benefits**
  - Keeping the saved state external from the key object helps to maintain [cohesion](../ch9/ch9.md)
  - Keeps the key object's data encapsulated
  - Provide easy-to-implement recovery capability
- **Usage & Drawbacks**
  - The Memento is used to save state
  - A drawback to using Memeto is that saving and restoring state can be time consuming
  - In Java systems, consider using Serialization to save a system's state
