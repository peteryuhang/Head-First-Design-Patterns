- **The Interpreter Pattern**
  - Build an interpreter for a language
- **Benefits**
  - Representing each grammar rule in a class makes the language easy to implement
  - Because the grammar is represented by classes, you can easily change or extend the language
  - By adding new additional methods to the class structure, you can add new behaviors beyond interpretation, like pretty printing and more sophisticated program validation
- **Usage & Limitation**
  - Use interpreter when you need to implement a simple language
  - Appropriate when you have a simple grammar and simplicity is more important than efficiency
  - Used for scripting and programming language
