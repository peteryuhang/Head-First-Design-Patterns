- **The Bridge Pattern**
  - Use the bridge pattern to vary not only your implementations, but also your abstractions
- **Benefits**
  - Decouples an implementation so that it is not bound permanently to an interface
  - Abstraction and implementation can be extended independently
  - Changes to the concrete abstraction classes don't affect the client
- **Usage**
  - Useful in graphic and windowing systems that need to run over multiple platforms
  - Useful anytime you need to vary an interface and an implementation in different way
