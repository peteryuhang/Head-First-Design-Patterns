- **The Flyweight Pattern**
  - Use the Flyweight Pattern when one instance of a class can be used to provide many "virtual instances"
- **Benefits**
  - Reduces the number of object instances at runtime, saving memory
  - Centralizes state for many "virtual" objects into a single location
- **Usage & Drawbacks**
  - The Flyweight is used when a class has many instance, and they can all be controlled identically
  - One you have implemented it, single, logical instances of the class will not be able to behave independently from the other instances
