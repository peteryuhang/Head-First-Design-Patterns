- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
  - Give more than one object a chance to handle a request
  - Each object in the chain acts as a handler and has a successor object. If it can handle the request, it does; otherwise, it forwards the request to its successor
- **Benefits**
  - Decouples the sender of the request and its receivers
  - Simplifies your object because it doesn't have to know the chain's structure and keep direct references to its members
  - Allows you to add or remove responsibilies dynamically by changing the members or order of the chain
- **Usage and Drawbacks**
  - Commonly used in windows systems to handle events like mouse clicks and keyboard events
  - Execution of the request isn't guaranteed; it may fall off the end of the chain if no object handles (this can be advantage or disadvantage)
  - Can be hard to observe the runtime characteristics and debug
