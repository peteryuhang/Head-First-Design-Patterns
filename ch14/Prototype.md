- **The Prototype Pattern**
  - Use the prototype pattern when creating an instance of a given class is either expensive or complicated
  - Prototype Pattern allow you to make new instances by copying existing instances and then modify it according to our needs
- **Benefits**
  - Hides the complexities of making new instances from the client
  - Provides the option for the client to generate objects whose type is not known
  - In some circumstances, copying an object can be more efficient than creating a new object
- **Usage & Drawbacks**
  - Prototype should be considered when a system must create new objects of many types in a complex class hierarchy
  - A drawback to using the Prototype is that making a copy of an object can sometimes be complicated
