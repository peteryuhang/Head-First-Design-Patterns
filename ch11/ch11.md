- **Remote Method Invocation(RMI)**: Gives us a way to find objects in a remote JMV and allows us to invoke their methods
- **Steps for making the remote service**: 
  1. Make a **Remote Interface**
    - The remote interface defines the methods that a client can call remotely
    - Both the Stub and actual service will implement this
  2. Make a **Remote Implementation**
    - The is the class that does the Real work, real service
  3. Generate the **stubs** and **skeletons** using rmic
    - These are the client and server "helpers", will be create automatically by running a command in JDK
  4. Start the **RMI registry**
    - `rmiregistry` is like the white pages of a phone book. It's where the client goes to get the proxy (the client stub/helper object)
  5. Start the **remote service**
    - Get the service object up and running, so the service available for client
