- **The State Pattern**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class
  - The pattern encapsulate state into separate classes and delegates to the object representing the current state
  - Using composition to give the appearance of a class change by simply referencing different state objects
- **The State Pattern VS The Strategy Pattern**:
  - The class diagrams are essentially the same, but the two patterns differ in their **intent**
  - State pattern as an alternative to putting lots of conditionals in your context
  - Strategy pattern as a flexible alternative to subclassing
- Sometime we need to decide where to put the flow of state transition, on the **state classes** or the **context class**
  - By making this decision, you are making a decision as to which classes are closed for modification - the context or the state classes - as the system evolves
