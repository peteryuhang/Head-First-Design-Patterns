- The secret to learning **MVC**: **It's just a few patterns put together**
- MVC flow
  - You're the user, you interact with the view
  - The controller asks the model to change its state
  - The controller may also ask the view to change
  - The model notifies the view when its state has changed
  - The view asks the model for state
- Patterns in MVC
  - The view and controller implement the classic **Strategy Pattern**. The view is an object that is configured with a strategy. The controller provide the strategy. This keeps the view decoupled from the models
  - The display consists of a nested set of windows, panels, buttons, text lables and so on. Each display component is a **Composite**. When updates needed, it only has to tell the top view component, and Composite taks care of the rest
  - The model implements the **Observer Pattern** to keep interested objects updated when state changes occur. It keeps the model completely independent of the views and controllers
