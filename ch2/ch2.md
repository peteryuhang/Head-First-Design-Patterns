- Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern
  - In observer pattern, we call the publisher the SUBJECT and the subscribers the OBSERVERS
- **The Observer Pattern**
  - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, **all** of its dependents are notified and updated automatically
  - The observer pattern provides an object design where subjects and observers are loosely coupled
    - The only thing the subject knows about an observer is that it implements a certain interface
    - We can add new observers at any time
    - We never need to modify the subject to add new types of observers
    - We can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other
    - Change to either the subject or an observer will not affect the other
- **Design Principle**
  - Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
    - Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects
