- **A Pattern** is a solution to a problem in a context
  - The **context** is the situation in which the pattern applies. This should be a recurring situation
  - The **problem** refers to the goal you are trying to achieve in this context, but it also refers to any constraints that occur in the context
    - Problem consists of a goal and a set of constraints. We need to balance the goal and constraints
  - The **solution** is what you're after: a general design that anyone can apply which resolves the goal and set of constraints
