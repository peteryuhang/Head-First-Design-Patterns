- **A Pattern** is a solution to a problem in a context
  - The **context** is the situation in which the pattern applies. This should be a recurring situation
  - The **problem** refers to the goal you are trying to achieve in this context, but it also refers to any constraints that occur in the context
    - Problem consists of a goal and a set of constraints. We need to balance the goal and constraints
  - The **solution** is what you're after: a general design that anyone can apply which resolves the goal and set of constraints
- **Pattern Categories**(Most common)
  - **Creational**: Involve object instantiation and all provide a way to decouple a client from the object it needs to instantiate
    - Singleton
    - Abstract Factory
    - Factory Method
    - Builder
    - Prototype
  - **Behavioral**: Concerned with how classes and objects interact and distribute responsibility
    - Strategy
    - State
    - Observer
    - Iterator
    - Template Method
    - Command
    - Visitor
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Interpreter
    - Chain of Responsibility
  - **Structural**: Let you compose classes or objects into larger structures, or create new structures or new functionality
    - Facade
    - Composite
    - Proxy
    - Adapter
    - Decorator
    - Bridge
    - Flyweight
- Center you thinking on design, not on patterns. Use pattern when there is a natural need for them. If something simpler will work, then use it
- Don't underestimate the power of a shared vocabulary, it's one of the biggest benefits of Design Pattern
- Patterns didn't start with software, thery started with the architechture of building and town. In fact, the patterns concept can be applied in many different domains, eg.
  - Architectural Patterns (Buildings)
  - Application Patterns (MVC)
  - Domain-Specific Patterns (J2EE)
  - Business Process Patterns (Project Management)
  - Organizational Patterns (Development Team)
  - User Interface Design Patterns (GUI, Video game)
- **Anti-Pattern**: Tells you how to go from a problem to a **BAD** solution
  - By documenting anti-patterns we help others to recognize bad solution before they implement them
- Book recommended:
  - *Design Patterns*
  - *The Timeless Way of Building*
  - *A Pattern Language*
