- **Design Principle**
  - **Open-Closed Principle:** Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
    - Applying this principle everywhere is wasteful, unnecessary, and can lead to complex, hard to understand code
- **The Decorator Pattern**
  - Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
  - Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
  - **Key Points**
    - Decorators have the **same supertype** as the objects they decorate
    - You can use one or more decorators to wrap an object
    - Given that the decorator has the same supertype as the object it decorates, we can pass around a decorated object in place of the original (wrapped) object
    - The decorator adds its own behavior either before and/or after delegating to the object it decorates to do the rest of the job
    - Object can be decorated at any time, so we can decorate objects dynamically at runtime with as many decorators as we like
- Composition and delegation can often be used to add new behaviors at runtime
