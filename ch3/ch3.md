- **Design Principle**
  - **Open-Closed Principle:** Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
    - Applying this principle everywhere is wasteful, unnecessary, and can lead to complex, hard to understand code
- **The Decorator Pattern**
  - Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
  - Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
