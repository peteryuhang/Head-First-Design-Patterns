- **The Command Pattern**
  - Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations
  - A Command object is at the center of this decoupling and encapsulates a receiver with an action (or set of actions)
  - Invokers can be parameterized with Commands, even daynamically at runtime
- A **null object** is useful when you don't have a meaningful object to return, and yet you want to remove the responsibility for handling **null** from the client
- The way to implement a **history of undo operations**?
  - Instead of keeping just a reference to the last Command executed, can keep a stack of previous commands
- Other usage of Command Pattern:
  - queuing requests
  - logging requests
  - transactional systems
