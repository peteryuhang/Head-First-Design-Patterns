- **Factory Pattern**
  - All factory patterns encapsulate object creation
  - Encapsulate object creation and lead to more decoupled, flexible designs
  - Promote loose coupling by reducing the dependency of your application on concrete classes
  - Powerful technique for coding to abstractions, not concrete classes
  - **The Factory Method Pattern**
    - Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclass to decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclass
    - Rely on **inheritance**: object creation is delegated to subclasses which implement the factory method to create objects
    - The intent is to allow a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses
  - **The Abstract Factory Pattern**
    - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
    - Rely on **object composition**: object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface
    - The intent is to create families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes
  - Factory method as a static method
    - **Advantage**: No need to instantiate an object to make use of the create method
    - **Disadvantage**: Can't subclass and change the behavior of the create method
- **Design Principle**
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes
    - High-level components should not depend on low-level components; rather, they should **both** depend on abstractions
    - **Inversion** means the original top-to-bottom dependency chart change to both hight-level and low-level modules depending on the abstraction. We should think in the invert way as normal approach
    - **Guidelines** can help you avoid OO designs that violate this principle (not rule, just guidelines, if have good reason to break, can go ahead):
      - No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class
      - No class should derive from a concrete class
      - No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes
