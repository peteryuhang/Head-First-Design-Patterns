- **The Template Method Pattern**
  - Defines the skeleton of an alogrithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses
  - Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure
  - It gives us an important technique for code reuse
- To prevent subclasses from changing the algorithm in the template method, declare the template method as final
- The **Factory Method** is a specialization of **Template Method**
- **Usage of hook method**
  - Provide a way for subclass to implement an optional part of an algorithm, it can be skipped if not necessary
  - Give the subclass a chance to react to some step in the template method that is about to happen or just happened
- **Design Principle**
  - **The Hollywood Principle**: Don't call us, we'll call you
    - We allow low-level components to hook themselves into a system, but the high-level components determine when they are needed, and how
    - It allow low-level structures to interoperate while preventing other classes from becoming too dependent on them
    - Guides us to put decision-making in high-level modules that can decide how and when to call low level modules
